I'm making a set of triple-plots regarding brown dwarf variables.

# Let's prototype this in a Jupyter notebook.

# left hand: map of variables, with Q0 underneath
# middle: map of "stars with BD-compatible position in color-mag space", with Q0 underneath
# right: map of variable BD candidates, with Q0 underneath and possibly also gently flagging BDs and vars.

# I think red: variable, blue: BD cand, purple: both is a clear visual cue.
